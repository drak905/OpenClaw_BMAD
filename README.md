# BMad Method Plugin for OpenClaw

AI-driven agile development framework — the [BMad Method](https://github.com/bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD) as an OpenClaw plugin.

Each workflow spawns a dedicated specialist agent (Analyst, PM, Architect, etc.) with fresh context — no bleeding between workflows. The BMad Master orchestrates the full software development lifecycle: analysis → planning → solutioning → implementation.

## How It Works

**Why top-level?** OpenClaw sub-agents cannot spawn other sub-agents. bmad-master needs to spawn specialist agents, so it must be a [top-level agent](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/multi-agent) — not a sub-agent of main.

**Two execution modes:**
- **YOLO** — Autonomous. Sub-agent runs all steps without stopping. Master waits for announce, then proposes next workflow.
- **Interactive** — Sub-agent pauses after each step. User reviews output, gives feedback via the master. Master relays to sub-agent via `sessions_send`.

## Tools

| Tool | Called by | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `bmad_init_project` | Master | Initialize a BMad project (creates `_bmad/`, symlinks, state tracking) |
| `bmad_list_workflows` | Master | List available workflows based on current project state |
| `bmad_start_workflow` | Master | Prepare a workflow — returns task prompt for `sessions_spawn` |
| `bmad_load_step` | Sub-agent | Load the next step in the active workflow |
| `bmad_save_artifact` | Sub-agent | Save workflow output (always appends, dedup detection) |
| `bmad_complete_workflow` | Sub-agent | Mark workflow complete, update state |
| `bmad_get_state` | Master | Get current project state (phase, progress, artifacts) |

## Install

```bash
# Clone into OpenClaw extensions
git clone https://github.com/ErwanLorteau/BMAD_Openclaw.git ~/.openclaw/extensions/bmad-method

# Install dependencies
cd ~/.openclaw/extensions/bmad-method && npm install
```

## Configure

Add to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json5
{
  plugins: {
    load: {
      paths: ["~/.openclaw/extensions/bmad-method"]
    },
    entries: {
      "bmad-method": {
        enabled: true,
        config: {}
      }
    }
  },

  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        // BMad Master as a top-level agent with BMad tools
        id: "bmad-master",
        name: "BMad Master",
        tools: {
          allow: ["bmad-method"]  // Enable all BMad tools
        }
      }
    ]
  },

  tools: {
    agentToAgent: {
      enabled: true,
      allow: ["main", "bmad-master"]
    }
  }
}
```

Create the master's workspace:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace-bmad
```

Then restart:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Verify

After restart, confirm the plugin loaded:

```
[plugins] BMad Method plugin loaded. Method path: ...
[plugins] BMad Method: registered 7 tools
```

## Usage

1. **Start a chat with the BMad Master agent** — it has all 7 BMad tools and will guide you through the full workflow: analysis → planning → solutioning → implementation.

2. The BMad Master role-plays as different personas (Analyst, PM, Architect, etc.) while the plugin manages state and step progression.

## Workflow

```
User → main → sessions_send → bmad-master
                                    ↓
                          bmad_init_project
                                    ↓
                         bmad_start_workflow → task prompt
                                    ↓
                         sessions_spawn(task) → sub-agent
                                    ↓
              bmad_load_step → execute → bmad_save_artifact (repeat)
                                    ↓
                        bmad_complete_workflow
                                    ↓
                          announce → bmad-master
                                    ↓
                          propose next workflow
```

## BMad Phases

| Phase | Agent | Workflows |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Analysis | Mary (Analyst) | Product Brief, Market/Domain/Technical Research |
| Planning | John (PM), Sally (UX) | PRD, UX Design |
| Solutioning | Winston (Architect) | Architecture, Epics & Stories, Readiness Check |
| Implementation | Bob (SM), Amelia (Dev) | Sprint Planning, Stories, Dev, Code Review |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test           # Run tests
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript check
```

## Architecture History

- **V1** (deprecated branch): Multi-agent via `sessions_spawn` with 12 agent prompts — abandoned due to complexity
- **V2** (PR #7): Single-session persona role-playing — abandoned due to context bleeding across workflows
- **V3** (current): Top-level master agent spawning sub-agents per workflow — see [Issue #8](https://github.com/ErwanLorteau/BMAD_Openclaw/issues/8) for the full journey
